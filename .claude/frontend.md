# Frontend Development Guide

This project is a backend-only Hono server. There is no frontend included.

For client integration, see the API documentation in [backend.md](./backend.md).

The API is designed to be consumed by any client application (React, Vue, mobile apps, etc.) and returns consistent JSON responses following REST principles.
